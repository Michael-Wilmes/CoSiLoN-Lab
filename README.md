# Edge AI Lab

This repository contains a laboratory project focused on building and evaluating
an isolated network based on Raspberry Pis.

The project explores the interaction between infrastructure, edge software,
and machine learning components in a controlled, offline-capable environment.

This is an evolving project and not all components are production-ready.
